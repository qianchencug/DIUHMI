The cube(49501m).pcd and Qinghai.rar are the point clouds used in the paper.

The sensor of point clouds of cube, Case A and Case B are (-0.2,0.1,-1.5), (10,1.1,2), and (0,-100,100), respectively.

The view of point clouds of cube, Case A and Case B are (290,30), (45,10), and (45,30), respectively.

The k of cube, Case A and Case B are 50, 60, and 60, respectively.

Note: The MATLAB version we use is R2022b.
